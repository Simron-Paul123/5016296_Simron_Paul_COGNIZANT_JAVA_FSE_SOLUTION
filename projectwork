Project: Employee Leave and Attendance Management 
System
1. Introduction
This document outlines the Low-Level Design (LLD) for an Employee Leave and Attendance Management 
System, which automates the process of tracking employee attendance, managing leave requests, and 
calculating working hours.
This design supports both Java (Spring Boot) and .NET (ASP.NET Core) frameworks for backend 
development.
2. Module Overview
2.1 Employee Attendance Module
• Allows employees to mark attendance, view their attendance history, and track daily clock-in 
and clock-out times.
• Provides managers with a dashboard to monitor attendance records and detect 
irregularities.
2.2 Leave Management Module
• Employees can request different types of leave (sick leave, vacation, etc.) and track the 
status of leave requests.
• Provides managers with a system for approving or rejecting leave requests.
2.3 Leave Balance Module
• Tracks and updates the leave balances for each employee based on the type of leave and the 
company's leave policies.
• Automatically adjusts leave balances as leaves are approved or rejected.
2.4 Shift Management Module
• Allows the assignment of shifts to employees based on company scheduling needs.
• Employees can view and swap shifts based on availability and manager approval.
2.5 Reports and Analytics Module
• Generates reports on attendance trends, leave usage, and shift coverage.
• Provides insights into workforce availability and helps in identifying patterns in leave 
requests or attendance issues.
3. Architecture Overview
3.1 Architectural Style
• Frontend: Angular or React for creating a dynamic user interface.
• Backend: REST API-based architecture for handling all business logic and data processing.
• Database: Relational Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server) for storing employee 
attendance, leave, and shift data.
3.2 Component Interaction
• The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs to manage employee 
attendance, leave requests, and shift assignments.
• The backend handles data storage and retrieval from the database.
4. Module-Wise Design
4.1 Employee Attendance Module
4.1.1 Features
• Employees can clock in and out for each workday.
• Attendance records are stored in real-time and can be accessed by both employees and 
managers.
4.1.2 Data Flow
• Employees log their attendance via the frontend.
• The backend processes the attendance data and stores it in the database. Managers can 
access the records in real-time.
4.1.3 Entities
• Attendance
o EmployeeID
o ClockInTime
o ClockOutTime
o WorkHours
4.2 Leave Management Module
4.2.1 Features
• Employees can request leaves by specifying the type and duration of the leave.
• Managers can approve or reject leave requests.
4.2.2 Entities
• LeaveRequest
o LeaveID
o EmployeeID
o LeaveType (Sick, Vacation, etc.)
o StartDate
o EndDate
o Status (Approved/Rejected)
4.3 Leave Balance Module
4.3.1 Features
• Automatically updates the employee’s leave balance upon leave approval.
• Ensures that employees cannot request more leave than their available balance.
4.3.2 Entities
• LeaveBalance
o EmployeeID
o LeaveType
o Balance
4.4 Shift Management Module
4.4.1 Features
• Managers can create and assign shifts to employees.
• Employees can view assigned shifts and request to swap shifts.
4.4.2 Entities
• Shift
o ShiftID
o EmployeeID
o ShiftDate
o ShiftTime
4.5 Reports and Analytics Module
4.5.1 Features
• Generate reports on attendance records, leave balances, and shift assignments.
• Provides analytics on leave trends and attendance patterns to management.
4.5.2 Entities
• AttendanceReport
o ReportID
o EmployeeID
o DateRange
o TotalAttendance
o Absenteeism
5. Deployment Strategy
5.1 Local Deployment
• The system can be deployed locally for internal testing and review by HR or payroll teams.
5.2 Testing Environments
• Use containerized environments (Docker) for staging and quality assurance testing to ensure 
consistency.
6. Database Design
6.1 Tables and Relationships
• Attendance: Primary Key: AttendanceID, Foreign Key: EmployeeID.
• LeaveRequest: Foreign Key: EmployeeID.
• LeaveBalance: Foreign Key: EmployeeID.
• Shift: Foreign Key: EmployeeID.
7. User Interface Design
7.1 Wireframes
• Attendance Dashboard: Displays daily attendance logs, current attendance status, and 
history.
• Leave Requests: Allows employees to submit leave requests and view the status of previous 
requests.
• Shift Schedule: Displays upcoming shifts and allows employees to request shift swaps.
8. Non-Functional Requirements
8.1 Performance
• The system must handle the attendance logging for up to 1,000 employees simultaneously 
without significant delay.
8.2 Usability
• The user interface must be easy to use for both non-technical employees and HR personnel.
8.3 Security
• Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized personnel can 
approve leave requests or view sensitive data.
8.4 Scalability
• The system should scale to accommodate an increasing number of employees and leave 
records without requiring major infrastructure changes.
9. Assumptions and Constraints
9.1 Assumptions
• All employees have internet access and are familiar with basic computing.
9.2 Constraints
• Initially, the system will be limited to a single branch or location with fewer than 500 
employees
